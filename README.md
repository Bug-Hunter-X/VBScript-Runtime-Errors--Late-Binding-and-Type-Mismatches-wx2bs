This repository demonstrates a common VBScript runtime error related to late binding and type mismatches.  Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to unpredictable behavior if not handled carefully. The example shows how to cause this error and how to mitigate it with proper error handling and type checking.  See bug.vbs for the buggy code and bugSolution.vbs for the corrected version.
