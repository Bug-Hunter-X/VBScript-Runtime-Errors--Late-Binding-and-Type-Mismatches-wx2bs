Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript's late binding can lead to runtime errors if the object or method you're accessing doesn't exist or is of the wrong type.  This often occurs when interacting with COM objects or external libraries without proper error handling.  For example, attempting to call a method on an object that hasn't been properly initialized can lead to a type mismatch error.
